## Introduction

In the first chapter we explored and considered answers to the following questions:

!!! question "Questions"

    1. What is public engagement?
    2. What are the goals of public engagement?

In discussing possible answers we took for granted the underlying values that support and motivate different forms of public engagement.
For instance, values like shared understanding that are enacted through activities such as democratic deliberation. These values matter, and so we could also ask a third question:

!!! question "Additional Question"

    1. What are the different values that support and motivate public engagement?

Addressing this question will be the main focus of this chapter.

    1. What are the goals and values of public engagement?
    2. What does it mean to conduct responsible public engagement for data science and AI?

With the conceptual foundations laid, we now turn towards the more practical side of public engagement.

## Chapter Outline

- [Deliberative Values](deliberation.md)
- [Responsible Public Engagement in Data Science and AI](responsible.md)

!!! info "Chapter Summary"

    In this chapter we will delve into this foundational question to further our understanding of the social significance and importance of public engagement, as well as to ground the subsequent discussion of what constitutes 'responsible public engagement'.
    To help anchor our discussion we will focus on the second goal of the previous chapter: deliberation.

!!! example "Learning Objectives"

    This chapter is designed to help you identify and evaluate the different ethical and social values that are implicated in all public engagement activities. By the end of the chapter you should have a better understanding of why these values matter, and also be able to use the SAFE-D principles to assess whether a particular research or innovation project is responsible.
