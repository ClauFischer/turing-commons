## Introduction

In the previous chapters we discussed the following topics:

!!! summary

    1. What are the goals and values of public engagement?
    2. What does it mean to conduct responsible public engagement for data science and AI?

With the conceptual foundations laid, we now turn towards the more practical side of public engagement.

## Chapter Outline

- [When should you engage?](when.md)
- [How should you engage?](how.md)

!!! info "Chapter Summary"

    This chapter begins by reviewing two models that can help us locate activities and methods for public engagement within a broader project lifecycle for data science and AI. 
    The objective is to use these models to support informed answers to the following questions:
    
    - How should you engage?
    - When should you engage? 

!!! example "Learning Objectives"

    By the end of this chapter you should have a strong comprehension of the project lifecycle model and be able to use this to scaffold your own project planning activities to help answer
    
    - How should you engage?
    - When should you engage?
