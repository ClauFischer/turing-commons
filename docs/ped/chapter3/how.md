# How should you engage?

There are many different methods for engagement in data science and AI.
If you recall the discussion from [chapter 1](../chapter1/index.md), these range from the one-sided processes of 'informing' to the more empowering types of engagement that strengthen the capabilities of the public and enable them to participate in and contribute to more diverse forms of science and technology.

We are going to look at three types of engagement:

1. Communication of science and technology
2. Public deliberation
3. Participatory design

The guidance offered in this section is not exhaustive—there are many more methods of engagement than we can cover in a single course.

!!! example "Education and Outreach"

    - Education or outreach
    - Websites and social media
    - Presentations
    - Posters and displays
    - Exhibitions
    - Theatre, Film, and Documentaries
    - Festivals

And, some engagement can be very creative. Consider the following two examples of science outreach:

=== "Deadinburgh"

    ![Image title](https://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/sites/default/files/case-study/deadinburgh-136_2.jpg)
    
    "An unknown pathogen ravages Scotland’s capital, turning the unlucky souls into bloodthirsty ambling beasts. You are one of the last uninfected citizens in a city under martial law, cut off from the rest of the UK. Now, with help from real scientists, you have only hours to decide how to save Edinburgh, and perhaps the world. The Enlightenment Café: Deadinburgh, produced by LAStheatre, introduces the audience to the worlds of epidemiology and biomedical science through a night of immersive theatre. In a theatrical world, with actors playing the infected hordes and besieged soldiers, the audience meet genuine scientists using real science to solve a fictitious disease. In the end the audience must decide whether to destroy the city, cull the infected, or search for a cure; the fate of the city is in their hands. Through the outbreak of a zombie epidemic Deadinburgh asks ‘what does it really mean to be human’ whilst offering parallels with real life science and procedures for managing disease outbreaks."

=== "Billenium (Future Places Toolkit)"

    <div class="result" markdown>

    ![Image title](https://www.scienceopen.com/document_file/67887571-d27c-41b9-b3ad-6723886228bf/ScienceOpen/image/rfa05020003_fig2.jpg){ align=left width=300 }

    Billennium was a mobile augmented reality (AR) project that took place in Bristol, UK in 2018. Participants used mobile devices to be guided on an AR tour, not of their city in the present day, but of possible architectural futures. The tour was designed to help promote members of the public engage in discussion and futures thinking about how their city could be design together.

## Communication of Science and Technology

Consider the following cases:

=== ":octicons-log-16: Policymakers"

    A research team has released results from an economics study that could have a positive impact on public policy. They decide to share these results with policymakers. The goal is to directly influence policy. Therefore, the results need to be clearly communicated and also connected to the policy goal. This connection is important to help ensure that policy-makers are able to evaluate the wider implications of the scientific findings. 

    **Communication Goal:** to demonstrate how scientific findings can support evidence-based policy impact

=== ":octicons-people-16: General Public"

    As part of an education outreach campaign to improve digital literacy among adolescents, a mental health charity are running workshops with secondary school students. They wish to communicate recent evidence about the impact of over-using social media on mental health. Rather than communicating complicated statistical information about the methods used in their study, the team develop a more accessible form of their findings and link these findings to practical steps that the students can take to protect themselves online.

    **Communication Goal: to build awareness of possible risks associated with excessive social media usage and support behavioural change strategies

=== ":octicons-beaker-16: Researchers"

    A PhD student working in a Physics department has results from a recent study that developed and tested a new method for the large-scale data mining of astronomical data. The PhD student wish to present this new method and the validation study at an upcoming international conference for data science. The audience will be technically literate, but will not have specialist expertise in astronomy. Therefore, the PhD student describes the method in the context of its original study buy also emphasises the generalisability for other sciences (e.g. genomics).

    **Communication Goal: to advance academic career by gaining experience of presenting conference papers and also generating interest in a novel data science method

A common need with all of the above cases is the tailoring of the communication strategy to the engagement goal. And, in all cases, a clear message is vital.

Consider the following visual communication from the Education Endowment Foundation—an independent charity with the goal of improving educational attainment of the poorest pupils in English schools.

![The Teaching and Learning Toolkit—Educational Endowment Foundation](../../assets/images/graphics/education.png)

The goal of this visual communication is to clearly summarise the evidence base for different education interventions, by focusing on three properties:

- Cost
- Strength of Evidence
- Impact

Obviously there is a lot more behind these three properties, but they serve as an accessible overview to help direct the attention of the audience.

Already, we have identified several key principles for how to communicate effectively:

- Know your audience
- Identify the goals of communication
- Have a clear and targeted message
- Use supporting visuals

[Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/tips-for-effective-science-communication/) also identify several of these principles, while also offering additional ones:

!!! example "10 Principles for How to Communicate Effectively"

   1. *Know your audience*
   2. *Identify the goals of communication*
   3. Start with the most important information
   4. Avoid jargon
   5. Be relatable
   6. *Provide visuals*
   7. Stick to three points
   8. Talk about the scientific process
   9. Focus on the bigger impact
   10. Develop an elevator pitch

We'll come back to this final principle in the activity at the end of this section.

## Public Deliberation

https://www.opengovpartnership.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Deliberation_Series_Volume-2_Informed_Participation-Guide.pdf

!!! quote "Consensus Statement on Public Involvement and Engagement with Data Intensive Health Research"

    the public should not be characterised as a problem to be overcome but a key part of the solution to establish socially beneficial data-intensive health research for all. (Aitken et al. 2019)

- What are the acceptable uses of patient data in health research?

!!! bug "Types of Health Data"

    - Data from patient records;
    - Administrative data (e.g. from social care, housing or education); • Data from registries;
    - Genomic data (e.g. from biobanks);
    - Data generated through use of apps;
    - Social media data.

## Participatory Design

https://www.designkit.org/methods/33?ref=guidetouxr.com 

!!! activity "Developing an Elevator Pitch"

    In groups, you are going to draft an elevator pitch for the case study you are developing.
    This pitch should be *audience agnostic*.
    In other words, it should be accessible for anyone who you may bump into "in the elevator".

    Once you've developed the elevator pitch, you are then going to pick one of the following groups and consider how you would revise the pitch if you knew you were discussing the project with th
