# Bias mitigation

When you are considering how to put the principle of discriminatory non-harm into action, you should come together with all the managers on the project team to map out team member involvement at each stage of the AI project lifecycle from design to deployment. pipeline from alpha through beta. Considering fairness-aware design and implementation from a workflow perspective will allow you, as a team, to concretise and make explicit end- to-end paths of accountability in a clear and peer-reviewable manner. This is essential for establishing a robust accountability framework. Here is a schematic representation of the fairness aware workflow. You will have to complete the final row.

Considering fairness aware design and implementation from such a workflow perspective will also assist you in pinpointing risks of bias or downstream discrimination and streamlining possible solutions in a proactive, pre-emptive, and anticipatory way. At each stage of the AI project lifecycle (i.e. at each column of the above table), you and the relevant members of your team should carry out a collaborative self-assessment with regard to the applicable dimension of fairness. This is a three-step process:

1. Identify the fairness and bias mitigation dimensions that apply to the specific stage under consideration (for example, at the data pre-processing stage, dimensions of data fairness, design fairness, and metrc-based fairness may be at issue).

2. Scrutinise how your particular AI project might pose risks or be vulnerable to deficiencies in each of these fairness areas.

3. Take action to correct any existing problems that have been identified, strengthen areas of weakness that have possible discriminatory consequences, and take proactive bias-prevention measures in areas that have been identified to pose potential future risks.
