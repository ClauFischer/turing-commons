# Bias Mitigation

# Bias Self-assessment and Risk Management
Considering fairness-aware design and implementation from a workflow perspective will assist you in pinpointing risks of bias or downstream discrimination and streamlining possible solutions in a proactive, pre-emptive, and anticipatory way. At each stage of the AI project lifecycle, you and the relevant members of your team should carry out a collaborative Bias Self-assessment with regard to the applicable dimension of fairness. This self-assessment consists of three steps:

**Step 1:**
Familiarise yourself with biases and fairness types that are relevant to each project stage.

**Step 2:**
Reflect and identify how your particular AI project might be vulnerable to biases that may arise at each stage and pose risks to each relevant fairness type.

**Step 3:**
Determine and document bias risk mitigation actions you will impmenent to correct any existing problems that have been identified, strengthen areas of weakness that have possible discriminatory consequences, and take proactive bias-prevention measures in areas that have been identified as potential sources of risk.


The Fairness Self-Assessment and Risk Mitigation template will help you go through this process. It locates a set of social, statistical, and cognitive biases within specific steps of an AI project lifecycle. These biases require ongoing reflection and deliberation to minimise the possible negative impact upon downstream activities or the risk of discriminatory outcomes.

## List of Biases
### Bias categories

**Social bias:**
Social bias has to do with the way that pre-existing or historical patterns of discrimination and social injustice – and the prejudices and discriminatory attitudes that correspond to such patterns – can be drawn into the Al lifecycle. In particular, it relates to how these patterns and attitudes can be perpetuated, reinforced, or exacerbated through the development and deployment of data-driven technologies.

**Statistical bias:**
Statistical bias refers to a systematic deviation from an expected statistical result that arises due to the influence of some additional factor. This understanding is common in observational studies where bias can arise in the process of sampling or measurement. Statistical biases can involve errors (deviations from a true state) or differences between measured or calculated values and true values.

**Cognitive bias:**

Bias Self-Reflection and Risk Mitigation Across the Workflow


The Bias self-reflection and risk mitigation template is to be initially completed during the Project Planning step of the AI lifecycle, informed by the PS Report and the list of biases provided. It is to be iteratively revisited and updated as a part of completing your Stakeholder Impact Assessment, each time identifying and responding to emerging biases through mitigation activities, and providing up-to-date documentation on the project’s management of non-discrimination.

Fairness Position Statement 

During the model Training, Testing, and Validation step, you and your project team are to establish a fairness metric for your system by thoroughly considering the use case appropriateness as well as technical feasibility of the fairness metrics most relevant to your system. You should prepare a Fairness Position Statement (FPS), in which the metric-based fairness criteria being employed in the model is made explicit and explained in plain and nontechnical language. This FPS should then be made publicly available for review by all affected stakeholders.
