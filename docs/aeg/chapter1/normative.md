# Introduction to Normative Ethical Theories

In contrast with metaethics, which is concerned with the nature of ethics, normative ethics is concerned with the content of ethical theories. Normative ethical theories attempt to give an answer to the question of what makes someone ethical, or what makes certain actions morally permissible or not. 
There is no shortage of ethical theories which come in different flavours. Here we will group them into the three main families of theories.

## Consequentialist Theories
Consequence-based theories are normative theories which, as the name suggests, define whether an action is morally permissible in terms of the consequences it brings about. In simple terms, they define morality as a matter of maximising the *best possible consequences* in any given situation.
This then begs the question, what are the best cosnequences to be maximised? Consequentialists have given different answers to this questions.

One very influential flavour of consequentialism is utilitarianism, which specifies that the way we should rank consequences is by how much total (aggregate) utlity they bring about (where more utlity is better).[^utility] Other examples of consequentialist theories are hedonism, act conseuquentialism, and rule consequentialism.[^kinds]
[^utility]: The question as to what exactly utility is and how one goes about measuring it poses all sorts of complications which are beyond the scope of this introduction.
[^kinds]: For a list of different kinds of consequentialist theories see the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry on Consequentialism[@sep-consequentialism].
However, what makes a normative ethical theory consequentialist is that, given a metric for what good consequences are (as well as a way of ranking better and worse  consequences), it then states that in any situation, the morally aproppriate way to act is to choose the action (among the existing possibilities) that brings about the best consequence.


## Deontological Theories

Deontological theories in contrast, take a different approach. Morality is not to be measured by the consequences actions bring about, but instead morality dictates that one should follow a set of rules or principles regardless of what the consequences are.

The most famous proponent of deontological theories is Immanuel Kant, who was a firm believer in rule or duty-based morality, and who went as far as to define the maxim or principle to be followed in order to act morally which we called the Categorical Imperative. This rule roughly states that one must always act as if oneâ€™s actions could be willed into a universal rule that everyone  in society follows.

## Virtue Ethics

Virtue ethics is not concerned with how people should act in a particular situation, but instead on what kind of people they are. Virtue ethicists emphasise that morality has to do with having a certain moral character which is achieved by cultivating virtues.

For the purposes of the rest of the course we will focus mostly on the first two families of theories, with a particular focus on principles-based approaches to ethics.
