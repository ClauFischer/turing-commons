# Introduction to Metaethics

# What is practical ethics?
Practical ethics is a branch of philosophy, in particular a branch of ethics which is concerned with examing the aims and principles of moral bheaviour and apply them to various problems of our everyday lives or real-world scenarios in general.[@uehiro]

In this course, we will look at issues in practical ethics which arise from our use of AI systems and the prevalence of data in our lives. To do so, we will introduce some key concepts in metaethics and some of the most relevant ethical theories in use today.


## What is Metaethics? 
Metaethics, as its name suggest, attempts to understand the various aspects (metaphysical, epistemological, semantic, and psychological) that make up the presuppositions and commitments of moral thought, talk and practice.[@sep-metaethics2014]

What does this mean? Metaethics deals with a variety of quite complex, yet relevant questions, such as the following:

- Is there anything such an objective moral truth? Or is morality more a matter of taste?
- Are all cultural moral standards equally valid or true?
- Are there moral facts? And if they exist, what is their origin?
- How are moral facts (if they exist) related to other kinds of facts about our world?
- If the do exist, how do we learn about morality and moral facts?[@sep-metaethics2014]

Clearly, none of these questions will have straightforward or easy answers, and we will not be dealing with them extensively in this course. However, in this brief introduction to practical ethics, we will look at three broad ways people have attempted to answer the question:

     What are moral facts? And where do they come from?



## Moral realism or objectivism 

Roughly speaking, being an objectivist about morality requires believing that objective moral facts do exist (and most likely also known by us humans). Objective moral truths also imply that things like subjectivity, context, or culture are not relevant when evaluating the morality of a person or an act.

The existence of objective moral truths clearly begs the question: where do these facts come from? Traditionally, they have been thought to be derived divinely. 

## Relativism
On the contrary, relativism negates that moral facts do exist in an objective way, detached from any subjective individual or collective experiences, cultures, and contexts.
It does not neceserarily negate that moral facts might exist in some capacity, but there may be a multiplicity of them, which might contradict each other, and are always contingent on a specific context and culture.



## Proceduralism
