# Introduction to Metaethics

# What is practical ethics?
Practical ethics is a branch of philosophy, in particular a branch of ethics concerned with examing the aims and principles of moral behaviour and apply them to various problems of our everyday lives or real-world scenarios in general.[@uehiro]

In this course, we will look at issues in practical ethics which arise from our use of AI systems and the prevalence of data in our lives. To do so, we will introduce some key concepts in metaethics and some of the most relevant ethical theories in use today.


## What is Metaethics? 
Metaethics, as its name suggest, attempts to understand the various aspects (metaphysical, epistemological, semantic, and psychological) that make up the presuppositions and commitments of moral thought, talk and practice.[@sep-metaethics2014]

What does this mean? Metaethics deals with a variety of quite complex, yet relevant questions such as the following:

- Is there anything such an objective moral truth? Or is morality more a matter of taste?
- Are all cultural moral standards equally valid or true?
- Are there moral facts? And if they exist, what is their origin?
- How are moral facts (if they exist) related to other kinds of facts about our world?
- If the do exist, how do we learn about morality and moral facts?[@sep-metaethics2014]

Clearly, none of these questions will have straightforward or easy answers, and we will not be dealing with them extensively in this course. However, in this brief introduction to practical ethics, we will look at three broad ways people have attempted to answer the question:

     What are moral facts? And where do they come from?



## Moral realism 
Moral realists, roughly speaking, accept the following two statements:
1. There are such things as moral facts or properties; and;
2. These are independent of human attitudes towards them (this is called attitude independence).

In practice, these means that moral realists believe that objective moral facts do exist, and there is only one "set" of these facts. Objective moral truths also imply that things like subjectivity, or culture are not relevant when evaluating whether an act is good or bad. Moral realism is, in and of itself, neutral on what it is exactly that makes something good or bad; it just is prepared that **facts about this exist**. 

Of course, this does not mean that subjectivity or culture play no role in what people think is good or bad. However, the moral realist is prepared that those differences, and any human attitude over what makes something good or bad, is irrelevant when evaluating moral facts. That is, the reason why some things are good or bad do not hinge on whehther people, culture, or society evaluate them as good or bad.

The existence of objective moral truths clearly begs the question: where do these facts come from? This is what is known as the 'grounding problem'.  One way this question has been traditionally answered is that these facts are derived divinely; by one God or multiple deities. There are also views which 

## Moral anti-realism
The opposite of a moral realist is an anti-realist. As the name suggest, a moral anti-realist is prepared to declare either:

1. There are no objective moral facts.
2. There are moral facts, but they are not independent of human attitudes towards them.

## Proceduralism
### Relativism
