!!! abstract "Chapter Summary"

    This chapter introduces the basic theoretical building blocks for learning AI ethics. We will briefly look at metaethics; in particular the different positions of objectivism, relativism, and proceduralism, and how these affect the way we do practical ethics.
    Additionally, we will delve into the main normative theories in practical ethics: consequentialist theories, deontological theories, and virtue ethics. These concepts will be useful to paint the ethical landscape against which the sub-field of AI (Practical) Ethics has developed.
