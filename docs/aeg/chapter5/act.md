# Act transparently and responsibly

The imperative of acting transparently and responsibly is a call to all AI and data science researchers, developers, deployers and users to marshal the habits of responsible research and innovation cultivated in the CARE processes to produce systems that prioritise data stewardship and that are robust, accountable, fair, non-discriminatory, explainable, reproducible, and replicable. 

While the mechanisms and procedures which are put in place to ensure that these normative goals are achieved will differ from project to project we can summarise the following priorities that should be incorporated into a team's governance, self-assessment, and reporting practices:

- **Full documentation of data provenance, lineage, linkage, and sourcing:**

- **Full documentation of privacy, confidentiality, consent, and data protection due diligence.**

- **Transparent and accountable reporting of processes and results and appropriate publicity of datasets.**

- **An end-to-end process for bias self-assessment.**
