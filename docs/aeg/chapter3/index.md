!!! abstract "Chapter Summary"

   In this chapter we take an in-depth look at AI Sustainability through the processes of stakeholder engagement and impact assessment. We start by looking at the concept of sustainability and the importance anticipatory reflection has on it.

   Then, we look at the role stakeholders play in sustainability through stakeholder engagement processes (SEP) as well as stakeholder impact asssessments (SIA). The former is a three-staged process which includes: (i) a stakeholder analysis and salience stage, (ii) a positionality reflection, and (iii) a stakeholder engagement objective and method selection. 
   
   The latter goes beyond the SEP and is designed to ensure a project remains sustainable and supports the sustainability of impacted communities throughout time. Beyond development and initial deployment, an AI system requires continuous monitoring to ensure that the long-term transformative effects and impacts of the project are not only well-understood, but accepted and beneficial for impacted individual and communities.
